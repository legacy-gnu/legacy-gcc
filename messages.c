/*
		ERRORS

	We print the error message 1st, beginning in column 1.
	All ancillary info starts in column 2 on lines after the
	key error text.
	We try to print a location in logical and physical file
	just after the main error text.
	Caller then prints any appendices after that, begining all
	lines with at least 1 space.

	Optionally, we may die.
	There is no need for a trailing '\n' in your error text format
	because we supply one.

as_warn(fmt,args)  Like fprintf(stderr,fmt,args) but also call errwhere().

as_fatal(fmt,args) Like as_warn() but exit with a fatal status.
