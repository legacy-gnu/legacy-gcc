NAME
	xrealloc () - get more memory or bust
INDEX
	xrealloc () uses realloc ()
SYNOPSIS
	char   *my_memory;

	my_memory = xrealloc (my_memory, 42);
	/* my_memory gets (perhaps new) address of 42 chars *//*

DESCRIPTION

	Use xrealloc () as an "error-free" realloc ().It does almost the same
	job.  When it can 't honour your request for memory it BOMBS your
	program with a "virtual memory exceeded" message.  Realloc() returns
	NULL and doesn 't bomb your program.

	realloc ()
