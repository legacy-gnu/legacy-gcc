This directory contains the version 2.1 release of the GNU C compiler.
This is the second test release of GCC version 2.

See the file gcc.texi (together with other files that it includes) for
installation and porting information.  The file INSTALL contains a
copy of the installation information, as plain ASCII.

Installing this package will create various files in subdirectories of
/usr/local/lib, which are passes used by the compiler and a library
named libgcc.a.  It will also create /usr/local/bin/gcc, which is
the user-level command to do a compilation.

The GNU C compiler is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying
permission.

The files print-self.c and print-self1.c are not part of GCC.
They are programs that print themselves on standard output.
They were written by Dario Dariol and Giovanni Cozzi, and are
included for your hacking pleasure.
